## Responsive Web Design 🖥️

### Introduction 🏁

This README provides an overview of the approach used to create a responsive web design for a web page. The goal was to ensure that the web page looks and functions well on various screen sizes and devices.

### Code Adjustments 🕹️

🎨 General Styles
The CSS code begins with general styles that apply to all screen sizes and devices.
The background gradient and font styles are defined here.
The box-sizing property is set to border-box for consistent box sizing.

👑 Header Styles
The header section contains the site logo, navigation links, and login/account buttons.
The logo's maximum width is set to 40vw, ensuring it scales proportionally with the viewport width.

🧭 Navigation links and buttons have defined styles for consistent appearance. Media queries are used to adjust the logo's maximum width for larger screens to ensure it doesn't become too large.

📌 Main Content Styles
The main content section includes a left container with phone images and a right container with text and a form.
The phone images are positioned absolutely, ensuring they stay in the correct location regardless of screen size.
The vw unit is used for font sizes and heights, making them responsive to the viewport width.
Input fields and buttons have defined styles for consistency.
Media queries adjust the positioning and sizing of elements for screens with a minimum width of 768px.
The logo's maximum width is set to 100% in larger screens to make it scale with the screen size.

📡 Media Queries
Media queries are used to apply different styles based on the screen size.
At a minimum width of 768px, styles are adjusted for larger screens.
This includes changes to the logo size, phone image positions, font sizes, and input field widths.
The goal is to make the web page look well-designed and readable on both small and large screens.

### Conclusion 🎉

By following this approach, the web page seems to be made responsive, adapting to various screen sizes and iPad while preserving the positioning and measurement units. Media queries play a crucial role in ensuring a seamless user experience across different devices.
